2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP Conv/Acc/ptemp_reg input A B  is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance. Each input of DSP48 has 2 levels of pipelining.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP Conv/Acc/stemp_reg input A B  is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance. Each input of DSP48 has 2 levels of pipelining.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
Output pipelining  
DSP Conv/Acc/ptemp_reg output P  is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 output will improve performance. Both multiplier/adder output can be pipelined.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
Output pipelining  
DSP Conv/Acc/stemp_reg output P  is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 output will improve performance. Both multiplier/adder output can be pipelined.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Mux/n_0_LEDout_reg[15]_i_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Mux/LEDout_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell Mux/LEDout_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT Mux/LEDout_reg[15]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 16 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    Mux/LEDout_reg[0] {LDCE}
    Mux/LEDout_reg[10] {LDCE}
    Mux/LEDout_reg[11] {LDCE}
    Mux/LEDout_reg[12] {LDCE}
    Mux/LEDout_reg[13] {LDCE}

Related violations: <none>

AVAL-4#1 Advisory
enum_USE_DPORT_FALSE_enum_DREG_ADREG_0_connects_CED_CEAD_RSTD_GND  
Conv/Acc/ptemp_reg: DSP48E1 is not using the D port (USE_DPORT = FALSE). For improved power characteristics, set DREG and ADREG to '1', tie CED, CEAD, and RSTD to logic '0', and tie all D inputs to logic '1'.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-4#2 Advisory
enum_USE_DPORT_FALSE_enum_DREG_ADREG_0_connects_CED_CEAD_RSTD_GND  
Conv/Acc/stemp_reg: DSP48E1 is not using the D port (USE_DPORT = FALSE). For improved power characteristics, set DREG and ADREG to '1', tie CED, CEAD, and RSTD to logic '0', and tie all D inputs to logic '1'.
